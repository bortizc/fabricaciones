1. **Relationship between abstraction and representation**:
   - In the manifesto, you position "abstracto" as "what antecedes the image. The ocean in which images are islands" (section 0)
   - In the Norway talk, you discuss specific representational images (faces, animations) extensively
   - Tension: There's a potential contradiction between abstraction as prior to images versus abstraction as a quality within images

I understand completely. The Norway talk is indeed focused on the "islands" (specific images, examples, and their analysis) rather than the "ocean" (the abstract substrate from which images emerge). 

This isn't so much a contradiction as it is a difference in focus and purpose between the texts. The talk provides rich, concrete examples that can be integrated into your theoretical framework, but doesn't need to explicitly address every aspect of that framework.

Your point about not forgetting the "ocean" is valuable - as you incorporate elements from the Norway talk into your chapter, you'll want to maintain awareness of how these specific examples connect to your broader concept of abstraction as what precedes images.

This approach makes sense for your writing process: the talk provides vivid material to illustrate concepts, but the final text needs to explicitly connect these examples to your theoretical framework about abstraction. The manifesto provides the structure, while the talk provides content that can be selectively incorporated and contextualized within that structure.

Shall we move on to examining the next potential contradiction about authorship?

2. **The nature of authorship**:
   - Your manifesto states: "An image only has an author in the most minimal sense" (section 3)
   - Yet in the Norway talk, you discuss artistic intention in painting and animation at length
   - Tension: The degree to which authorial intention matters seems to vary between the texts

   I see the distinction now. You're pointing to an important historical trajectory in the evolution of authorship and images. The Balzac example represents a particular historical moment where the relationship between author and image was conceptualized differently - almost as a hermetic creation between painter and canvas.

The advent of photography began a significant shift away from this model, as you note. The mechanical reproduction of images started to separate authorship from creation in ways that weren't possible with painting. And as you point out, contemporary phenomena like memes have accelerated this process exponentially - images circulate, transform, and function as cultural placeholders with increasingly tenuous connections to any original "author."

This isn't so much a contradiction in your thinking as it is an observation about a historical process - from the Balzac painter's intimate relationship with his creation to the contemporary dispersal of authorship across digital networks.

If I understand correctly, you're suggesting that technology itself (whether painting techniques, photography, or digital reproduction) plays a determining role in shaping these author-image relationships. Each technological paradigm establishes different conditions for how authorship functions.

This clarification could be valuable to incorporate explicitly in your chapter - not as a contradiction to resolve, but as a historical process to articulate. The "minimal authorship" you describe in the manifesto can be positioned as the contemporary endpoint (so far) of this historical trajectory.

Shall we move on to the next potential contradiction?

3. **Opacity versus transparency**:
   - You claim "Any image is opaque. It hides much more than it reveals" (section 4 of manifesto)
   - But in your discussion of facial expressions and Parkinson's disease, you suggest faces can transparently reveal internal states
   - Tension: When is an image/face revealing versus concealing?

The thing is that faces play with this identity all the time. what struck me in the example with my father is that there was an image (made by me, entirely subjective) that I had and that I recognized on top of his own face as body

That's a really insightful clarification. What you're describing isn't actually a contradiction but rather a complex relationship that demonstrates your point about opacity.

The face example actually reinforces your concept of opacity in a profound way - what you recognized in your father's face after surgery wasn't direct transparency but rather the reappearance of an image (constructed by you) that you associated with his identity. The face wasn't transparent in showing some essential truth, but was rather functioning as a surface where you recognized a particular subjective image that you had constructed over time.

This interpretation aligns perfectly with your manifesto's position on opacity. The face doesn't directly reveal an internal reality in a transparent way; instead, it operates as a complex image where recognition happens through subjective construction. We project and recognize patterns rather than seeing through to some essential truth.

This example could actually serve as a powerful illustration of your theoretical point about opacity rather than contradicting it. It shows how even in our most intimate recognitions of others, we're engaging with images that are constructed, subjective, and ultimately opaque rather than transparent windows to identity.

Shall we continue to the next potential contradiction?

4. **Digital versus analog image perception**:
   - In the Norway talk, you posit a fundamental shift from optical to information-based image perception
   - Yet in your manifesto and notes, you suggest all images (analog and digital) function through similar principles of fragmentation and thresholds
   - Tension: Is digital imagery fundamentally different or just an extension of the same image principles?

Hmm. this is a tough one. Because I do believe that the image as information is a paradigm shift from the image as reflection (bear with me this is just to give a name to the "optical" image, reflection as reflection on a mirror, although it would be refraction through a lens if one wants to be precise). But at the same time I do think that the mechanism of illusion comes from perceiving thing as something. There is this paper by Whitney Davis that posits the theory that one day Homo Sapiens percieved random markings on a surface as an image of an animal or even a face, and that this created a quantum cognitive leap that piggy backed on evolutionary aspects of the human eye

That's a fascinating perspective that actually helps clarify what might have seemed contradictory. What you're describing sounds like two interrelated but distinct aspects of image function:

1. The technological paradigm of image creation and transmission (optical reflection/refraction versus computational information)

2. The cognitive mechanism of perception (recognizing something "as" something else) that remains consistent across these technological paradigms

Whitney Davis's theory about that pivotal cognitive moment when humans began seeing random markings "as" representations of animals or faces suggests a fundamental cognitive process that predates and transcends any specific image technology. This "seeing as" cognitive mechanism remains constant whether we're looking at cave paintings, Renaissance art, photographs, or AI-generated images.

So the continuity exists at the level of cognitive perception (the threshold moment when fragmented elements coalesce into recognized forms), while the rupture occurs at the level of how images are technically constructed and transmitted (from optical to informational).

This isn't so much a contradiction as a multi-layered analysis that distinguishes between persistent cognitive mechanisms and evolving technological paradigms. The manifesto focuses more on the enduring cognitive aspects, while parts of the Norway talk emphasize the technological shift.

Would explicitly distinguishing between these layers help resolve this apparent tension in your chapter?
