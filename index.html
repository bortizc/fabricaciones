        <li><strong>Relationship between abstraction and
        representation</strong>:
        <ul>
        <li>In the manifesto, you position “abstracto” as “what
        antecedes the image. The ocean in which images are islands”
        (section 0)</li>
        <li>In the Norway talk, you discuss specific representational
        images (faces, animations) extensively</li>
        <li>Tension: There’s a potential contradiction between
        abstraction as prior to images versus abstraction as a quality
        within images</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>I understand completely. The Norway talk is indeed focused on
        the “islands” (specific images, examples, and their analysis)
        rather than the “ocean” (the abstract substrate from which
        images emerge).</p>
        <p>This isn’t so much a contradiction as it is a difference in
        focus and purpose between the texts. The talk provides rich,
        concrete examples that can be integrated into your theoretical
        framework, but doesn’t need to explicitly address every aspect
        of that framework.</p>
        <p>Your point about not forgetting the “ocean” is valuable - as
        you incorporate elements from the Norway talk into your chapter,
        you’ll want to maintain awareness of how these specific examples
        connect to your broader concept of abstraction as what precedes
        images.</p>
        <p>This approach makes sense for your writing process: the talk
        provides vivid material to illustrate concepts, but the final
        text needs to explicitly connect these examples to your
        theoretical framework about abstraction. The manifesto provides
        the structure, while the talk provides content that can be
        selectively incorporated and contextualized within that
        structure.</p>
        <p>Shall we move on to examining the next potential
        contradiction about authorship?</p>
        <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li><strong>The nature of authorship</strong>:
        <ul>
        <li>Your manifesto states: “An image only has an author in the
        most minimal sense” (section 3)</li>
        <li>Yet in the Norway talk, you discuss artistic intention in
        painting and animation at length</li>
        <li>Tension: The degree to which authorial intention matters
        seems to vary between the texts</li>
        </ul>
        I see the distinction now. You’re pointing to an important
        historical trajectory in the evolution of authorship and images.
        The Balzac example represents a particular historical moment
        where the relationship between author and image was
        conceptualized differently - almost as a hermetic creation
        between painter and canvas.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The advent of photography began a significant shift away from
        this model, as you note. The mechanical reproduction of images
        started to separate authorship from creation in ways that
        weren’t possible with painting. And as you point out,
        contemporary phenomena like memes have accelerated this process
        exponentially - images circulate, transform, and function as
        cultural placeholders with increasingly tenuous connections to
        any original “author.”</p>
        <p>This isn’t so much a contradiction in your thinking as it is
        an observation about a historical process - from the Balzac
        painter’s intimate relationship with his creation to the
        contemporary dispersal of authorship across digital
        networks.</p>
        <p>If I understand correctly, you’re suggesting that technology
        itself (whether painting techniques, photography, or digital
        reproduction) plays a determining role in shaping these
        author-image relationships. Each technological paradigm
        establishes different conditions for how authorship
        functions.</p>
        <p>This clarification could be valuable to incorporate
        explicitly in your chapter - not as a contradiction to resolve,
        but as a historical process to articulate. The “minimal
        authorship” you describe in the manifesto can be positioned as
        the contemporary endpoint (so far) of this historical
        trajectory.</p>
        <p>Shall we move on to the next potential contradiction?</p>
        <ol start="3" type="1">
        <li><strong>Opacity versus transparency</strong>:
        <ul>
        <li>You claim “Any image is opaque. It hides much more than it
        reveals” (section 4 of manifesto)</li>
        <li>But in your discussion of facial expressions and Parkinson’s
        disease, you suggest faces can transparently reveal internal
        states</li>
        <li>Tension: When is an image/face revealing versus
        concealing?</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The thing is that faces play with this identity all the time.
        what struck me in the example with my father is that there was
        an image (made by me, entirely subjective) that I had and that I
        recognized on top of his own face as body</p>
        <p>That’s a really insightful clarification. What you’re
        describing isn’t actually a contradiction but rather a complex
        relationship that demonstrates your point about opacity.</p>
        <p>The face example actually reinforces your concept of opacity
        in a profound way - what you recognized in your father’s face
        after surgery wasn’t direct transparency but rather the
        reappearance of an image (constructed by you) that you
        associated with his identity. The face wasn’t transparent in
        showing some essential truth, but was rather functioning as a
        surface where you recognized a particular subjective image that
        you had constructed over time.</p>
        <p>This interpretation aligns perfectly with your manifesto’s
        position on opacity. The face doesn’t directly reveal an
        internal reality in a transparent way; instead, it operates as a
        complex image where recognition happens through subjective
        construction. We project and recognize patterns rather than
        seeing through to some essential truth.</p>
        <p>This example could actually serve as a powerful illustration
        of your theoretical point about opacity rather than
        contradicting it. It shows how even in our most intimate
        recognitions of others, we’re engaging with images that are
        constructed, subjective, and ultimately opaque rather than
        transparent windows to identity.</p>
        <p>Shall we continue to the next potential contradiction?</p>
        <ol start="4" type="1">
        <li><strong>Digital versus analog image perception</strong>:
        <ul>
        <li>In the Norway talk, you posit a fundamental shift from
        optical to information-based image perception</li>
        <li>Yet in your manifesto and notes, you suggest all images
        (analog and digital) function through similar principles of
        fragmentation and thresholds</li>
        <li>Tension: Is digital imagery fundamentally different or just
        an extension of the same image principles?</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Hmm. this is a tough one. Because I do believe that the image
        as information is a paradigm shift from the image as reflection
        (bear with me this is just to give a name to the “optical”
        image, reflection as reflection on a mirror, although it would
        be refraction through a lens if one wants to be precise). But at
        the same time I do think that the mechanism of illusion comes
        from perceiving thing as something. There is this paper by
        Whitney Davis that posits the theory that one day Homo Sapiens
        percieved random markings on a surface as an image of an animal
        or even a face, and that this created a quantum cognitive leap
        that piggy backed on evolutionary aspects of the human eye</p>
        <p>That’s a fascinating perspective that actually helps clarify
        what might have seemed contradictory. What you’re describing
        sounds like two interrelated but distinct aspects of image
        function:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>The technological paradigm of image creation and
        transmission (optical reflection/refraction versus computational
        information)</p></li>
        <li><p>The cognitive mechanism of perception (recognizing
        something “as” something else) that remains consistent across
        these technological paradigms</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whitney Davis’s theory about that pivotal cognitive moment
        when humans began seeing random markings “as” representations of
        animals or faces suggests a fundamental cognitive process that
        predates and transcends any specific image technology. This
        “seeing as” cognitive mechanism remains constant whether we’re
        looking at cave paintings, Renaissance art, photographs, or
        AI-generated images.</p>
        <p>So the continuity exists at the level of cognitive perception
        (the threshold moment when fragmented elements coalesce into
        recognized forms), while the rupture occurs at the level of how
        images are technically constructed and transmitted (from optical
        to informational).</p>
        <p>This isn’t so much a contradiction as a multi-layered
        analysis that distinguishes between persistent cognitive
        mechanisms and evolving technological paradigms. The manifesto
        focuses more on the enduring cognitive aspects, while parts of
        the Norway talk emphasize the technological shift.</p>
        <p>Would explicitly distinguishing between these layers help
        resolve this apparent tension in your chapter?</p>
